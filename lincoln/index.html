our fathers brought forth on this continent,
a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all
men are created equal.
  </p>

  <p>
	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation
	so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of
	that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place
	for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
	fitting and proper that we should do this.

   </p>

   <p>
	But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground.
	The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power
	to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can
	never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
	unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
	to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take
	increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we
	here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, 
	shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the
	people, shall not perish from the earth.
